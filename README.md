## üöÄ Usage
This tool, allow you to perform an ARP cache poisoning attacks between two targets (a `victim` and a `gateway`) on a local network. It manipulates the ARP tables of the victims to redirect network traffic through the attacker, enabling interception or modification of data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the help menu, you can see `-g GATEWAY` and `-t TARGET`. However, if you want to capture traffic between two victims without one of them being the gateway, you can still use this tool with `-g TARGET1` and `-t TARGET2`.
